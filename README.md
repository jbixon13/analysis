# Analysis, Analytics, Data Nerd Stuff 

## Why does this exist?
- Most of my analysis code is buried in other repositories, especially anything hosted on my Distill blog.
- Putting just the files necessary for each analysis in its own repo increases their ease of access.
- I avoid publishing code in the analysis posts I write.
  + They are meant to be approachable by non-technical people.
  + If you want to know how I built something in a post, this is where you can see how it was done.

## What you should know before going further
- Most of what you see is a work in process. 
- There is lots of code that generates outputs I have decided against publishing.
- If something seems out of place, I am likely still looking for a way to utilize it. 
- I work on lots of things that I can't publish. Most of my work here are personal side-projects.
